# Arduino Course Repository

This repository is designed as a **comprehensive resource for learning Arduino**. It contains organized materials, example codes, and hands-on projects that align with the lessons of the course. The purpose is to provide learners with a structured path to explore electronics, sensors, and microcontrollers using Arduino.

The content is arranged to gradually introduce concepts ‚Äî starting with the basics and progressing toward more advanced applications. covered in the course.

## üìã Repository Structure
1. lesson-1 | Introduction to Arduino
2. lesson-2 | Arduino Development Environment
3. lesson-3 | First Arduino code

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Navigate to the project or lesson folder you want to explore.  
2. Check the description or watch the YouTube video tutorial (link available inside the folder).  
3. Open the `.ino` file using the **Arduino IDE** or any compatible development environment.  
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board and run it.  
5. To download a project or lesson to your computer:  
   - Click the **Code** button on the project or lesson page.  
   - Select **Download ZIP**.  
   - Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location and start experimenting.   

## üéØ Goal of This Repository
* Provide a **practical learning path** for Arduino beginners.
* Offer ready-to-use code examples that match course lessons.
* Encourage experimentation and further exploration of electronics.
